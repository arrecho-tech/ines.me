                I’m an architect turned real estate leader who believes great spaces and good business should serve people first. I’m the co-owner and managing partner of Avanti Way East Miami, where I help agents build intentional, client-first businesses. I speak about branding, technology, and change management in real estate, translating “what’s new” into “what actually works.”

                I serve locally, statewide, and nationally with Miami Realtors, Florida Realtors, and NAR on initiatives that protect homeownership and elevate our profession. I also run Miamism, a long-running Miami real estate and lifestyle blog with a soft spot for architecturally significant homes. When I’m not on a stage or in strategy sessions, you’ll probably find me near the ocean, camera in hand.
